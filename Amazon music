Once a team is created, anyone with Admin access can invite new users to the team from within Amazon Music for Artists.

To add a new team member you must first load an artist profile that is included in the team you wish to grant access to. From the Overview page, click the profile photo in the top-right corner of the app and select Manage Team > Invite Team Member.

üõëAdding someone will give them access to ALL artist data mapped to your team - NOT just the individual artist profile you are viewing - so be sure to only invite essential team members.Since your image generation limit hasn't reset yet, I can‚Äôt create the image directly right now.

But here‚Äôs a text-based mockup of what the image will say and how it might be arranged ‚Äî you can visualize or even share it with a designer meanwhile:


---

Text Mockup Layout:

If you want, I can also help you generate a simple vector SVG or a mockup in code form for you to preview right away!

Would you like me to do that?

To create an accurate and visually appealing image combining the Apple TV+ logo with Harry TV, and the Apple Music logo with Harry Music, I need to clarify a few details:

1. Style Preference: Do you want the logos to be blended in a professional Apple-style aesthetic (minimalist, sleek), or should it have a more playful, artistic design?


2. Color Scheme: Should it follow Apple‚Äôs usual monochrome look, or do you prefer a colorful version?


3. "Harry TV" and "Harry Music": Are these actual brand names you're using or placeholders for a concept? Should the font/style resemble Apple‚Äôs branding?



Also, for best results, please upload any reference image or logo of ‚ÄúHarry TV‚Äù or ‚ÄúHarry Music‚Äù if available. Otherwise, I‚Äôll proceed with a clean, Apple-inspired design using the default Apple fonts and visual language.

Would you like me to proceed in that style?
